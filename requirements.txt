# Chess Pattern AI Dependencies

# ============================================================================
# CORE DEPENDENCIES (Required for headless training and pattern learning)
# ============================================================================

# Core chess library
python-chess>=1.9.0

# Data science and machine learning
numpy>=1.21.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0

# ============================================================================
# GUI DEPENDENCIES (Optional - only needed for ai_gui.py)
# ============================================================================
# NOTE: The GUI has complex dependencies that are difficult to install on Windows.
# We recommend using headless_trainer.py instead, which works on all platforms.
#
# If you want to use the GUI anyway:
# pillow>=9.0.0
# matplotlib>=3.5.0
# cairosvg>=2.5.0  # Requires Cairo C library (see SETUP.md for Windows install)
#
# On Windows, installing Cairo is complex. See SETUP.md for instructions.
# TL;DR: Use headless_trainer.py instead - it has all the same features!

# ============================================================================
# ARC PUZZLE SOLVING (Optional)
# ============================================================================
# scipy>=1.7.0  # Uncomment if needed for advanced features

# ============================================================================
# STANDARD LIBRARY (No installation needed)
# ============================================================================
# The following are part of Python's standard library:
# - tkinter (GUI toolkit - comes with Python on Windows)
# - json, csv, sqlite3
# - collections, dataclasses, typing
